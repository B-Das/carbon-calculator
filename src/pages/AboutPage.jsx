        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">How It Works</h2>
        <p>
          CarbonCalC uses internationally recognized greenhouse gas (GHG) accounting standards to calculate your 
          business's carbon footprint across three key areas:
        </p>
        
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 space-y-2">
          <li><strong>Electricity Usage:</strong> Calculates emissions from your office and facility energy consumption.</li>
          <li><strong>Business Travel:</strong> Tracks emissions from business-related air travel, car rentals, and other transport.</li>
          <li><strong>Employee Commuting:</strong> Estimates emissions from your team's daily commute to work.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Our Methodology</h2>

          Our calculator uses emission factors from reputable sources including:

          <li>Greenhouse Gas Protocol</li>
          <li>International Energy Agency (IEA)</li>
